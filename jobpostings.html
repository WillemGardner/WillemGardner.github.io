            <p>We are Matija and Martin, founders of Wasp (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;</a>) and twin brothers. We’re building a Rails&#x2F;Laravel-like full-stack framework that is designed to be stack and architecture-agnostic. Currently, we’re focusing on React, Node.js and Prisma.<p>Our secret sauce is a custom-built compiler at the heart of the framework, which “understands” how your app works across the whole stack - we’re relying a lot on code generation, and that gives us a lot of flexibility to do some pretty cool things [1] and cut down the boilerplate.<p>Since we launched Beta last year, we’ve seen quite strong community adoption [2] - Wasp has grown to ~14,000 stars on GitHub and is being used by indie hackers, startups, and Fortune 500 companies.<p>We’re currently a team of six - senior engineers (ex-Google&#x2F;Palantir) + growth and a devrel. We raised our first round after graduating from YC in 2021 [3] and just recently closed another round (details will be public soon).<p>We are looking for a well-rounded engineer with substantial web dev experience who wants to be a part of a strong engineering&#x2F;open-source culture and work on all aspects of the product with us - our custom compiler (in Haskell; but don’t worry about it [4]), frontend, backend, database&#x2F;infra, deployment, CLI, ….<p>This is a remote position - for more details, take a look here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a18a74854c80de9481c33ebe9cccff?pvs=4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a...</a><p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out at founders [at] wasp-lang [dot] dev<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;first-framework-that-lets-you-visualize-react-node-app-code">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;first-framework-that-l...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MatijaSosic&#x2F;status&#x2F;1839279924819145010" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MatijaSosic&#x2F;status&#x2F;1839279924819145010</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-seed-to-help-developers-build-web-apps-faster&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-se...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a18a74854c80de9481c33ebe9cccff#441924f85de94450973fa3ad835f9e23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a...</a></p>

            </hgroup>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Imagine if the internet were a database. What would you build?<p>---<p>We’re building out the early engineering team of expand.ai, where we’re (a) solving a problem the world urgently needs to be solved, that is (b) one of the most challenging problems in technology, (c) alongside a team of exceptional engineers (d) offering you the chance to have a massive impact, (e) while having fun (f) and be reward accordingly.<p>(a) Problem<p>While LLMs are democratizing intelligence, access to data remains a huge bottleneck. We&#x27;re changing that by building state-of-the-art web extraction agents that structure millions of websites—one at a time.<p>Scraping is not new. Folks have written XPaths, manual beautiful soup scripts, etc.<p>However, two things changed:<p>1. Scraping is needed even more than before. Almost any AI application needs access to some data from the internet.
2. We’re in the post-LLM era. While LLMs are too expensive to run over the internet, they enable previously impossible capabilities.<p>That’s why we’re on a mission to build a reliable data layer for the web.<p>When we soft launched in September, we got an insane amount of interest, with over 170 demos booked in 24 hours. This confirms how much of a problem this is for folks.<p>We’re luckily not alone on this mission and have backing from the best: YCombinator, Guillermo Rauch (CEO, Vercel), Swyx (Founder, smol ai), Sarah Guo (Conviction Embed), Alana Goyal (basecase capital), Max Claussen (system.one), Ellen Chisa, Charly Poly, … and many more!<p>(b) Tech challenges<p>We have collectively coded for over 20 years and never faced this difficulty of a technical challenge. We’re building a highly dynamic system that needs to deal with the undeterministic nature of the internet, at scale.<p>Some of the challenges we’re tackling:<p>1. Building a fair system across multiple tenants (noisy neighbors)
2. Quickly scaling up and down web agent and AI infra depending on demand
3. Coordinate thousands of web agents that concurrently try to extract data
4. High-quality data pipelines to make sure our clients get only the correct data. We care a lot about reliability and correctness.
5. Scaling our system to millions of websites
6. Our agents need to be able to perform actions on websites - not all of them directly show the information we need to get!
7. As this is such new territory, a lot of the tooling we need doesn’t exist yet and we have to build it ourselves.<p>What is our answer to these? How will we win?<p>In short - good old software engineering.<p>Longer Answer:<p>- We’re making heavy use of [Effect](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;effect.website&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;effect.website&#x2F;</a>), which allows us to gain as much control as you possibly can in such an undeterministic environment. Also, it will enable us to represent complex agentic workflows while keeping a deep level of observability.
- We’re making use of the latest advances in AI, including training our own models and using the latest insights from research.
- It took us a while to arrive at the current system design, and we certainly don’t have all the answers yet, but we have iterated on our main architecture multiple times, which allows us to represent very complex workflows.<p>(c) Team<p>We’re a nimble team of 2 right now.<p>1. [Tim Suchanek](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timsuchanek">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timsuchanek</a>) (Founder)
    1. Tim was the first engineer at Prisma, where he led the development of several tools, including the GraphQL Playground and Prisma ORM, which are now used by millions of developers.
    2. Tim then founded Stellate, a GraphQL API management company that handled billions of monthly requests from customers like Nasa, Puma, and Priceline. Stellate was acquired by Shopify in 2024.
    3. Tim does Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) as a hobby and holds a blue belt in it.
2. [Tylor Steinberger](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TylorS">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TylorS</a>) (Founding Engineer)
    1. Tylor joined the Cycle.js project early on, building out major parts of the system.
    2. After a career in startup tech, Tylor last led the frontend development at Seasoned, where he implemented one of the [first functional full-stack frameworks](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TylorS&#x2F;typed">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TylorS&#x2F;typed</a>), which is still used today.
    3. As a hobby, Tylor implements his own programming language and always thinks about how to push the boundaries of programming.
3. You
    1. What kind of engineering profile are we looking for? You’re a good fit if you
        1. Are backend-focused and have worked on a difficult project before
        2. Have a machine-learning background and have built data pipelines before
        3. Have worked on scalable infrastructure

            </hgroup>

            <p>We’re looking for a hacker to join our team of 3 on-site in San Francisco. You would be one of the founding engineers; why join us, when you can start a company yourself or work at an OpenAI? Here’s our case:<p>Instant is (a) a really hard problem (b) that users want (c) worked on by an excellent team (d) where you can have immense impact and (e) be compensated accordingly.<p>Let me explain:<p>## (a) a really hard problem<p>For the last two years, we’ve been hacking on Instant, the modern Firebase. Instant is a database you can use directly from the browser; you write queries, and they stay in sync, work offline, and come with optimistic updates out of the box. You get auth, and a system for running permissions too. You also have support for presence, and SDKs for React, vanilla JS, and React Native.<p>For years we were in a cave building and talking to a core group of users; Instant turned out to be one of the hardest products we’ve ever worked on. We built a multi-tenant architecture, so we could offer a free tier that never freezes (you can even spin up a database without signing up, check out the tutorial [1]. We had to write a query engine on the backend, and a sync layer on top of that. To do it, we scoured articles on Figma’s LiveGraph, Asana’s Luna, and Andy Pavlo’s courses.<p>We open sourced last month, and had one of the largest Show HN’s for a YC company [2]. And soon after that, we announced a 3.4M seed round, backed by James Tamplin (the founder of Firebase), Paul Graham, Greg Brockman, Jeff Dean, Amjad Masad, Karri Saarinen, and 50+ technical angels.<p>## (b) that users want<p>Since launch, we have been flooded with user requests. Some of the largest infra and AI companies have reached out to us for integrations. We have people asking for enterprise deals, and had to turn some down due to bandwidth.<p>You probably resonate yourself — you know how much of a schlep software development can be: spin up databases, write endpoints, funnel data to store, and finally paint screens. You do all of that, and the app is just ok. If you want to make it great, time to add reactivity, optimistic updates, and offline mode.<p>It doesn’t have to be this hard. There’s a missing abstraction, and it looks like a database you can use in the browser. Companies like Figma, Asana, Linear, and Notion have all built this internally. It’s obvious to us that most apps will be built this way in the future, and we built Instant to power them.<p>## (c) worked on by an excellent team<p>For the longest time, we’ve been a very small team: right now it’s just 3 of us: Joe Averbukh, Daniel Woelfel, and me. We’ve known each-other for 10 years, and have worked across companies together. We think small teams of very talented people are special; It’s more fun, you get more autonomy, and you form relationships for life.<p>This is how it feels at Instant. Each of us own projects that would have deserved large infrastructure orgs at other companies. Each of us takes our craft and our word seriously; it’s a breath of fresh air to work together, knowing that when you ask for help, you have someone who you deeply respect by your side.<p>## (d) where you can have immense impact<p>Our current architecture got us to a new stage, but to really excel at this next stage, there’s <i>a lot more</i> to do.<p>We recently had to turn down 2 customers because they would have added 2 magnitudes more traffic. Our infrastructure can’t handle that yet, but perhaps with your help, they will. Maybe you could dive deep into our sync engine: what kind of algorithms can we write to improve invalidation? How can we jig postgres to make queries even faster? How can we send less data to the client?<p>We have a storage service in beta. We want to make it the best one on the market. We want files to live in your database too, so they can be reactive, and work with permissions out of the box. You shouldn’t have to deal with presigned URLs. You shouldn’t need triggers to sync different datastores. You should just be able to upload files from the client.<p>We have a multi-tenant database you can start with, but what about existing companies? They already use Postgres. Well, what if we created a Postgres adapter for Instant? We could take Instant queries and translated them to postgres SQL. What kind of [postgres introspection queries](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;instantdb&#x2F;instant&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;server&#x2F;src&#x2F;instant&#x2F;db&#x2F;pg_introspect.clj#L28">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;instantdb&#x2F;instant&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;server&#x2F;src&#x2F;in...</a>) would you need to write to infer the schema?<p>Right now we have no story for load testing. We want to build a suite to track metrics to track perf and have visibility on improvements&#x2F;degradation. Even something akin to the one-laptop solution [4] Figma had up to 2020 would be a big win for us. Can you build it?<p>Or how about our client side SDK. Our reactive layer on the client is a state machine, and it’s getting out of control. Maybe it’s time to introduce observables. Can you add them? We should be able to introspect into the state of the client: what happens when you make a transaction? Can we see it propagate and change throughout the SDK?<p>## (e) be compensated accordingly<p>If this was a few months ago, I would not have written this, I didn’t think the risk&#x2F;reward would be worth it for you. But at this point, I really think it is. We’re just at the point where we could hit PMF with your help, and since we haven’t raised an A yet, we can offer you significant equity to make it happen.<p>If you’re the kind of person who gets excited about this stuff, who truly loves their craft, and wants to work with others who do, who moves fast, but isn’t afraid to look deep into the ‘scarier’ programming problems. we want to talk to you.<p>You can reach out to us at founders [at] instantdb<p>[1] Tutorial: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instantdb.com&#x2F;tutorial">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instantdb.com&#x2F;tutorial</a><p>[2] Show HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41322281">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41322281</a><p>[3] Seed round: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;stopachka&#x2F;status&#x2F;1841514927099437144" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;stopachka&#x2F;status&#x2F;1841514927099437144</a><p>[4] One laptop solution: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;keeping-figma-fast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;keeping-figma-fast&#x2F;</a></p>
