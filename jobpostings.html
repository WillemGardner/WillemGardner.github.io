            <p>Hi HN! We&#x27;re building Stack Auth (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stack-auth.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stack-auth.com&#x2F;</a>), an open-source managed authentication and authorization platform. Basically, we build your login and signup pages, and everything that comes with that.<p>You can find our customer pitch elsewhere, so instead I&#x27;ll tell you more about us and the company. We are developers building for other developers, so you can think of everyone here as a devX engineer. We launched with a Show HN in April, and have been growing exponentially since.<p>Think of us as a fast-moving open-source infrastructure business. We spend a lot of time thinking about how we can maintain the agility of a startup while being as reliable as incumbents. Sometimes, this means new ideas; for example, we heavily rely on AI and snapshots for our E2E tests, and have API migration tooling that blows everyone else out of the water. If you have ideas like these, we want you.<p>We&#x27;ve sworn to keep a no-bullshit culture. We&#x27;re all pulling on the same string; we don&#x27;t keep secrets from each other and always assume good faith. We want to build the open-source cloud infrastructure of the future; we&#x27;d rather die trying than sell out for a quick buck.<p>We are (very) well-funded by investors such as YC, Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, Theo Browne, and Khosla Ventures. Our number one priority is to build an outstanding product that developers *really* love — everything else comes second.<p>For now, we are exclusively hiring onsite in San Francisco; sadly, we don&#x27;t currently have any remote positions. Optionally, you can move with us into our hacker house (both temporarily or permanent), but you can live in your own home too.<p>If that sounds like a great fit, email me mentioning that you&#x27;re from HN and tell me why we caught your eye: konsti (at) stack-auth.com<p>Thanks all!</p>

            <p>We are Matija and Martin, founders of Wasp (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;</a>) and twin brothers. We’re building a Rails&#x2F;Laravel-like full-stack framework that is designed to be stack and architecture-agnostic. Currently, we’re focusing on React, Node.js and Prisma.<p>Our secret sauce is a custom-built compiler at the heart of the framework, which “understands” how your app works across the whole stack - we’re relying a lot on code generation, and that gives us a lot of flexibility to do some pretty cool things [1] and cut down the boilerplate.<p>Since we launched Beta last year, we’ve seen quite strong community adoption [2] - Wasp has grown to ~14,000 stars on GitHub and is being used by indie hackers, startups, and Fortune 500 companies.<p>We’re currently a team of six - senior engineers (ex-Google&#x2F;Palantir) + growth and a devrel. We raised our first round after graduating from YC in 2021 [3] and just recently closed another round (details will be public soon).<p>We are looking for a well-rounded engineer with substantial web dev experience who wants to be a part of a strong engineering&#x2F;open-source culture and work on all aspects of the product with us - our custom compiler (in Haskell; but don’t worry about it [4]), frontend, backend, database&#x2F;infra, deployment, CLI, ….<p>This is a remote position - for more details, take a look here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a18a74854c80de9481c33ebe9cccff?pvs=4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a...</a><p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out at founders [at] wasp-lang [dot] dev<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;first-framework-that-lets-you-visualize-react-node-app-code">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;first-framework-that-l...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MatijaSosic&#x2F;status&#x2F;1839279924819145010" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MatijaSosic&#x2F;status&#x2F;1839279924819145010</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-seed-to-help-developers-build-web-apps-faster&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-se...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a18a74854c80de9481c33ebe9cccff#441924f85de94450973fa3ad835f9e23" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.notion.site&#x2F;Framework-Engineer-at-Wasp-12a...</a></p>
