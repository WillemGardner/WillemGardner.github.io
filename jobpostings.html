            <p>Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a>.<p>Backed by YC, Coatue, the CTO of GitHub, CEO of Vercel, CPO of Adobe and others, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai?utm_source=hn">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai?utm_source=hn</a> monitors how developers interact with your app and automatically generates and maintains test coverage nearing 100%. Even for the most complex applications. All without needing to write or maintain a single test.<p>Our customers find it increases their end-to-end frontend development velocity by over 20%. If you’ve ever had the rare chance of working on a project where you can have near 100% confidence in your changes before you hit merge you’ll understand this immediately: programming feels completely different in that environment. Every dev can refactor with complete confidence and speed. And so they do, keeping the code fresh &amp; nimble. Our customers’s developers have been able to move faster than they’ve often ever experienced before.<p>We’re growing rapidly, and want to provide this experience to every software company in the world — while freeing them of the burden of writing or maintaining tests. We’ve built a team of exclusively world-class software engineers (“One of the strongest teams that I have seen” - Jared Friedman, Partner at Y Combinator).<p>If you join us we’ll promise you’ll learn faster than you ever have in your career, and will be able to fundamentally change how the world develops software.<p>## How does Meticulous work?<p>You add a script tag on localhost and internal stacks, and Meticulous records all the development teams daily interactions with the app as they develop features. Meticulous understands every line of code, component and route executed by each flow and uses this to maintain a visual snapshot test suite that covers close to 100% of your code. This suite tests your apps UI, user flows and logic at all layers, across all edge cases, all branches, all feature flags. As your app evolves, your test suite evolves.<p>The tests are executed in an environment that ensures full determinism from the lowest level, right down to how the browsers’ macro &amp; micro-tasks are scheduled — so no flakes. This bedrock of determinism is what makes the full system possible.<p>You can watch a 60 second demo at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai?utm_source=hn">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai?utm_source=hn</a>.<p>## What’s our team like?<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir, GitHub and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of six. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds. - Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism. - Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar. - Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub.</p>
