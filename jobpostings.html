            <p>TL;DR: We are hiring 100% remote founding engineers with competitive salaries and outsized equity grants that match our strong traction. We want every team member to have a clear, vested interest in our success.<p>We are on a mission to become the Uber of auto repair. Carma has built a network of top-tier auto service centers that bid for same-day service requests. We are gaining significant traction in the B2B sector, focusing on business fleet customers—think large companies in construction, landscaping, cleaning services, and pest control. These businesses feel the pain of auto repair most acutely, often spending millions annually. While we are currently focused on this market, we have plans to expand into the consumer space in the future.<p>As a founding engineer, you will experience a tight customer feedback loop. Your work will be deployed daily, receiving immediate market feedback from our customers and partner service centers—both of whom rely on Carma daily to power their businesses.<p>Our go-to-market strategy is highly effective, and we are consistently acquiring new enterprise customers each month.
We iterate rapidly, prioritizing speed and maintaining a tight feedback loop with customers above all else.<p>We&#x27;re experiencing rapid growth, with our revenue increasing by 40% month-over-month. We were among the first companies accepted into the W24 batch and emerged as one of the top-funded non-AI startups, securing over $5 million in funding.<p>What is Carma and how does it work?<p>Carma is a B2B managed marketplace that provides same-day automotive repair for commercial fleet owners. We offer instant, transparent quotes and guaranteed pricing for any vehicle. Our mission is to tackle the $573 billion problem in commercial auto repair: the challenge for fleet owners to efficiently find automotive services and for repair shops to attract customers.<p>Fleet owners can request any service through our mobile app. We then send these requests to our network of highly-vetted partner service centers. These partners provide real-time offers for the requested services, ensuring quick and competitive responses.<p>Our fleet customers save over 50% when using Carma compared to the median price for the same service in their zip code. Meanwhile, our partner service centers increase their revenue and acquire new customers.

We operate three datacenters with high performance servers we&#x27;ve built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We&#x27;ve implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical company where you&#x27;ll spend half of your time in meetings— at MixRank you&#x27;ll get to direct your entire focus into difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.<p>We&#x27;re hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren&#x27;t singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you&#x27;ll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you&#x27;ll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we&#x27;ll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we&#x27;ll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.<p>--<p>Junior Software Engineer<p>We&#x27;re looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend&#x2F;backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.<p>Ideally you&#x27;ve already finished with school, but if you still have one or more years left please feel free to apply anyway. If you&#x27;re the right fit for the team we&#x27;ll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.<p>Please apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.dover.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;mixrank">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.dover.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;mixrank</a><p>--<p>Software Engineer<p>We&#x27;re hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning&#x2F;data science, data transformation&#x2F;ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more. We&#x27;ll customize the role to whatever subset of these areas match your interests.<p>Beneficial experience includes PostgreSQL, Python, Linux, TypeScript, Rust, Nix, frontend&#x2F;backend web development, and data mining.<p>Please apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.dover.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;mixrank">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.dover.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;mixrank</a><p>--<p>We especially encourage ex-founders in software engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, design, and product to reach out. If you don&#x27;t see a relevant position open, reach out to jobs at mixrank.com. We care more about the person than the job position, and we&#x27;re happy to craft the perfect position for anyone that joins our team.</p>
